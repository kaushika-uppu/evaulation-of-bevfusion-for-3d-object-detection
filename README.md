# Evaluating Performance of LiDAR and Camera Fused 3D Object Detection Using BEVFusion

***Abstract*** — Autonomous driving significantly relies on the ability to detect and localize 3D objects within a complex environment. Two inputs typically used for this problem are LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and cameras. With both technologies having pros and cons, using a fusion of LiDAR and cameras could lead to a more comprehensive 3D perception system with higher accuracy and robustness. This project aimed to integrate BEVFusion, a state-of-the-art multi-sensor fusion framework, into a ROS-2 environment to evaluate 3D object detection on the NuScenes dataset.
